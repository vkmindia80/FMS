# RBAC System - Testing & Verification Guide

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. Initial Setup ✅

**RBAC System Initialized Successfully!**
- ✅ 46 permissions created
- ✅ 5 system roles created (Superadmin, Admin, Manager, User, Auditor)
- ✅ 11 default menus created
- ✅ System superadmin user created: `superadmin@afms.system` / `admin123`

### 2. First User Registration

When you register a new user (the first regular user), they will automatically:
1. Create a company
2. Get registered
3. **Automatically receive Superadmin role** 🎉

**Test Steps:**
1. Go to `/register`
2. Fill in registration form
3. Upon successful registration, this user will have full admin access
4. Navigate to `/admin` to access the Admin Panel

### 3. Admin Panel Features

**URL**: `/admin`

**Required Permission**: `users:manage` OR `roles:view`

#### Users Tab
- View all users in your company
- See user details (name, email, role, status)
- Click "Manage Roles" to assign/unassign roles to users
- Visual user cards with avatar initials

#### Roles Tab
- View all available roles
- See role details (name, description, permission count, user count)
- Create new custom roles
- Edit existing roles (except system roles)
- Delete custom roles (if no users assigned)
- Assign permissions to roles via checkbox interface

#### Permissions Tab
- View all 46 system permissions
- Grouped by resource (dashboard, transactions, accounts, etc.)
- Shows permission name, action type, and description
- Visual indicators for system permissions

### 4. Dynamic Menu Rendering

**Before Login**: Standard navigation
**After Login with Permissions**: 
- Menu items automatically filter based on user permissions
- "Admin Panel" menu item only appears for users with `users:manage` or `roles:view`
- Other menu items hide if user lacks required permissions

**Test**: 
1. Login as superadmin → See all menu items including "Admin Panel"
2. Create a user with "User" role → They won't see "Admin Panel"
3. Create a user with "Admin" role → They will see "Admin Panel"

### 5. Permission-Based UI Elements

Example pages include permission guards that show/hide buttons:

#### Transaction Page Example:
```jsx
// Create button - only visible if user has 'transactions:create'
<PermissionGuard permission="transactions:create">
  <button>Create Transaction</button>
</PermissionGuard>

// Edit button - only visible if user has 'transactions:edit'
<PermissionGuard permission="transactions:edit">
  <button>Edit Transaction</button>
</PermissionGuard>

// Delete button - only visible if user has 'transactions:delete'
<PermissionGuard permission="transactions:delete">
  <button>Delete Transaction</button>
</PermissionGuard>
```

### 6. Testing Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Admin User Flow
1. Register as first user (auto-superadmin)
2. Navigate to `/admin`
3. Go to Roles tab
4. Create a new role "Finance Manager"
5. Assign permissions: transactions:*, accounts:view, reports:*
6. Go to Users tab
7. Create/invite another user
8. Assign "Finance Manager" role to new user
9. Login as new user
10. Verify they can only see permitted features

#### Scenario B: Role Permission Changes
1. Login as admin
2. Go to `/admin` → Roles tab
3. Select "Manager" role
4. Click Edit
5. Add/remove permissions
6. Save changes
7. Users with "Manager" role will have updated permissions on next login

#### Scenario C: Multiple Role Assignment
1. Login as admin
2. Go to `/admin` → Users tab
3. Select a user
4. Click "Manage Roles"
5. Select multiple roles (e.g., "Manager" + "Auditor")
6. Save
7. User now has combined permissions from both roles

### 7. API Testing

#### Get Permissions (requires authentication)
```bash
# First, login and get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"superadmin@afms.system","password":"admin123"}'

# Then use token to get permissions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8001/api/rbac/permissions
```

#### Get Roles
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8001/api/rbac/roles
```

#### Create Role
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/rbac/roles \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Custom Role",
    "description": "Test role",
    "permission_ids": ["permission-id-1", "permission-id-2"]
  }'
```

### 8. Visual Verification Checklist

- [ ] Admin Panel accessible at `/admin`
- [ ] Three tabs visible: Users, Roles, Permissions
- [ ] Users tab shows user cards with "Manage Roles" button
- [ ] Roles tab shows role cards with permission counts
- [ ] "Create Role" button visible in Roles tab
- [ ] Permissions tab shows grouped permissions
- [ ] Search functionality works in all tabs
- [ ] Modal opens when creating/editing roles
- [ ] Permission checkboxes work in role modal
- [ ] User role assignment modal works
- [ ] Sidebar shows "Admin Panel" menu item (for admin users)
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile

### 9. Permission Matrix

| Role | Dashboard | Transactions (Full) | Users (Manage) | Roles (Manage) | Reports | Settings |
|------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|---------|----------|
| Superadmin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Admin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (Create/Edit) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Manager | ✅ | ✅ (View/Create/Edit) | ✅ (View) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ (View) |
| User | ✅ | ✅ (View/Create) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (View) | ✅ (View) |
| Auditor | ✅ | ✅ (View) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (View/Export) | ❌ |

### 10. Known Limitations & Notes

**Limitations:**
- Redis is not running, so token blacklist and rate limiting are disabled (not critical for MVP)
- Celery worker not running, so report scheduling won't work (separate feature)
- Permission changes require re-login to take effect (by design for security)

**Security Notes:**
- JWT tokens are validated on every request
- Passwords are bcrypt hashed
- First user auto-superadmin feature should be disabled in production after initial setup
- System roles cannot be deleted
- Roles with assigned users cannot be deleted

### 11. Integration with Existing Pages

To add permission checks to existing pages:

1. **Import the components:**
```jsx
import PermissionGuard from '../components/common/PermissionGuard';
import { useHasPermission } from '../components/common/PermissionGuard';
```

2. **Wrap UI elements:**
```jsx
<PermissionGuard permission="transactions:create">
  <CreateButton />
</PermissionGuard>
```

3. **Use hooks for conditional logic:**
```jsx
const canEdit = useHasPermission('transactions:edit');
```

### 12. Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Admin Panel not showing in sidebar
- **Solution**: Ensure user has `users:manage` or `roles:view` permission

**Issue**: Changes not reflecting after role update
- **Solution**: User needs to logout and login again

**Issue**: Can't delete a role
- **Solution**: Check if role is system role or has users assigned

**Issue**: Permission denied errors
- **Solution**: Check user's assigned roles and their permissions

### 13. Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:
- [ ] Change superadmin password from default
- [ ] Disable auto-superadmin for first user (or keep for owner)
- [ ] Enable Redis for token blacklist and rate limiting
- [ ] Review and customize default roles for your business
- [ ] Set up proper backup for MongoDB (includes RBAC data)
- [ ] Document your custom roles and permissions
- [ ] Train administrators on role management
- [ ] Set up audit log monitoring
