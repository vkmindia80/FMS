# Bug Fixes Summary - Reconciliation & Documents

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Failed to Load Documents** ✅
**Root Cause:** Authentication token key mismatch in Reconciliation pages
- Documents page was correctly using `localStorage.getItem('afms_access_token')` ✅
- Reconciliation pages were incorrectly using `localStorage.getItem('token')` ❌

**Fix Applied:**
Updated all reconciliation components to use the correct token key:
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/reconciliation/ReconciliationPage.js` - 5 instances fixed
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/reconciliation/ReconciliationSession.js` - 4 instances fixed

Changed:
```javascript
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');  // ❌ WRONG
```

To:
```javascript
const token = localStorage.getItem('afms_access_token');  // ✅ CORRECT
```

### 2. **Reconciliation Sessions Empty** ✅
**Root Cause:** Same authentication token issue prevented fetching reconciliation sessions from the API

**Fix Applied:**
- Fixed token retrieval in `fetchSessions()`, `fetchAccounts()`, `loadSession()`, and `handleDeleteSession()` functions
- Now sessions will load correctly from `/api/reconciliation/sessions` endpoint

### 3. **Demo Data Generation - Document Type Issues** ✅
**Root Cause:** Document types in demo data generator didn't match the DocumentType enum

**Issues Found:**
- 'purchase_order' - not in enum ❌
- 'expense_report' - not in enum ❌
- 'contract' - not in enum ❌
- Missing required fields: `original_filename` and `document_type` in additional documents

**Valid DocumentType Enum Values:**
- `bank_statement`
- `credit_card_statement`
- `receipt`
- `invoice`
- `payroll_stub`
- `vendor_statement`
- `tax_document`
- `other`

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `/app/backend/demo_data_generator.py`:
1. Changed unsupported document types to 'other'
2. Added missing `original_filename` field
3. Added missing `document_type` field
4. Updated summary documentation
