## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Reconciliation Data âœ¨

#### Realistic Reconciliation Scenarios

The generator creates varied scenarios to test all aspects of the reconciliation module:

**A. Matched Transactions (70%)**
- System transactions that match bank entries
- Slight variations in amount (Â±$0.10) to simulate real-world data
- Date variations (Â±2 days) for realistic timing differences
- High confidence scores (0.95-0.99)
- Automatic matching enabled

**B. Outstanding Checks/Deposits (15%)**
- Transactions in the system but not yet in the bank
- Simulates timing differences
- Tests unmatched transaction handling
- Includes both checks and deposits

- Tests fuzzy matching algorithms
- Confidence scores: 0.70-0.85

#### CSV Bank Statement Format

Each CSV file contains:
```csv
