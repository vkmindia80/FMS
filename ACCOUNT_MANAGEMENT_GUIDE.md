## 📊 Account Balance Calculations

### How Balances Work

**Assets & Expenses** (Debit Normal Balance):
```
Balance = (Total Debits - Total Credits) + Opening Balance
```

**Liabilities, Equity & Income** (Credit Normal Balance):
```
Balance = (Total Credits - Total Debits) + Opening Balance
```

### Balance Updates
- Balances update automatically when transactions are created
- Journal entries affect account balances
- Category totals sum all account balances in that category

---

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Access Control
- All accounts are company-specific (multi-tenant isolation)
- Users can only see accounts from their company
- Role-based access control applies:
  - **Individual/Business**: Full account management
  - **Corporate**: Full access with additional features
  - **Admin**: System-wide access
  - **Auditor**: Read-only access

### Data Protection
- All API calls require authentication
- JWT tokens validate user identity
- Company_id filtering prevents cross-tenant access
