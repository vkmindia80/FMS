## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

**Risk 1: Email Service Integration**
- **Impact:** Phase 14 cannot complete without email
- **Probability:** Low (if API key provided)
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Choose SendGrid for easiest setup
  - Have backup SMTP option ready
  - Test with development email first

**Risk 2: Celery Worker Configuration**
- **Impact:** Report scheduling won't work
- **Probability:** Medium (new technology in stack)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use simple Celery setup first
  - Test with basic task before complex reports
  - Add comprehensive logging
  - Have fallback synchronous option

**Risk 3: Frontend Complexity (Phase 15 Matching UI)**
- **Impact:** Poor UX for reconciliation
- **Probability:** Medium (complex interaction)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Build simple version first
  - Iterate based on usability
  - Add progressive enhancement
  - Consider using existing drag-drop library

### Medium-Risk Items

**Risk 4: Report Export Performance**
- **Impact:** Slow email delivery, timeouts
- **Probability:** Medium (large reports)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Add file size limits
  - Implement pagination for large reports
  - Use async processing
  - Add progress indicators

**Risk 5: Currency Rate API Limits**
- **Impact:** Exchange rate updates fail
- **Probability:** Low (1,500 free requests/month)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Cache rates aggressively
  - Only update once daily
  - Upgrade to paid plan if needed ($9/month)
  - Have manual rate entry fallback
