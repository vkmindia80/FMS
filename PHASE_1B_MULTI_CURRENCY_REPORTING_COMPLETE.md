## 🔄 Currency Conversion Flow

### How Multi-Currency Reporting Works

1. **User Selection**
   - User selects display currency (e.g., EUR)
   - System notes base currency (e.g., USD)

2. **Data Retrieval**
   - Backend fetches all transactions
   - Transactions stored with original currency
   - Base currency amounts pre-calculated

3. **Currency Conversion**
   - If display ≠ base, convert amounts
   - Use exchange rates from transaction dates
   - Apply latest rates for current balances

4. **Report Generation**
   - Calculate totals in display currency
   - Show breakdowns by original currency
   - Include conversion rate information

5. **Display**
   - Present all amounts in selected currency
   - Optionally show original currencies
   - Export maintains currency data
