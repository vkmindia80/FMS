   - **Impact:** Demo-only, no real bank connections
   - **Recommendation:** Sign up for Plaid and configure credentials

3. **Webhook Configuration**
   - Stripe webhook infrastructure ready but not configured
   - **Impact:** Manual polling required for payment status
   - **Recommendation:** Configure webhook URL in Stripe dashboard

4. **Accounts Payable**
   - Backend ready, frontend not implemented
   - **Impact:** No UI for bill management
   - **Recommendation:** Implement in next sprint

5. **Invoice Frontend**
   - API fully functional, no frontend page yet
   - **Impact:** Invoice CRUD via API only
   - **Recommendation:** Implement InvoicesPage in next iteration
