2. **Generate Demo Data**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/auth/generate-demo-data
   ```

3. **Login with Demo Account**
   - Email: `john.doe@testcompany.com`
   - Password: `testpassword123`

### For Administrators
1. Review the API documentation at `http://localhost:8001/docs`
2. Configure MongoDB connection and JWT secrets in `.env`
3. Set up `EMERGENT_LLM_KEY` for AI document processing features
4. Run initial account setup: `POST /api/accounts/setup-defaults`

### For Testers
1. Use the demo data generation endpoint to create realistic test data
2. Test all user roles: individual, business, corporate, auditor, admin
3. Verify document upload and AI processing with sample receipts/invoices
4. Validate financial reports accuracy with known transaction sets
