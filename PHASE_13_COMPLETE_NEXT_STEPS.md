## 🎯 Next Steps - Phases 14 & 15

You have **TWO remaining phases** to reach ~80% completion:

### **Option A: Phase 14 - Report Scheduling System** (0% → 100%)
**Goal**: Automated report generation and email delivery

#### What Needs to Be Done:
1. **Backend Infrastructure (20 hours)**
   - Install Celery + Redis for background jobs
   - Configure Celery worker with supervisor
   - Implement mock email service (you chose option 'd')
   - Create report generation worker tasks
   - Build schedule runner with Celery beat

2. **Backend API (Already 70% Done!)**
   - ✅ 7 scheduling endpoints already exist
   - ✅ Schedule data models complete
   - ✅ MongoDB collections ready
   - 🔧 Just needs Celery integration

3. **Frontend UI (10 hours)**
   - Create report scheduling page
   - Build schedule creation form
   - Schedule list with filters
   - Manual trigger buttons
   - Execution history viewer

**Estimated Total**: 30-35 hours  
**Benefits**: Automated financial reports, email delivery, scheduled analytics

---

### **Option B: Phase 15 - Account Reconciliation** (10% → 100%)
**Goal**: Bank reconciliation workflow and transaction matching

#### What Needs to Be Done:
1. **Backend (Already 90% Done!)**
   - ✅ CSV/OFX/QFX parsing complete
   - ✅ Matching algorithm implemented
   - ✅ 8 reconciliation endpoints ready
   - ✅ Confidence scoring working
   - 🔧 Just needs testing

2. **Frontend UI (25-30 hours)**
   - Create bank statement upload page
   - Build drag-and-drop matching interface
   - Reconciliation dashboard
   - Review and completion workflow
   - Reconciliation reports viewer

**Estimated Total**: 25-30 hours  
**Benefits**: Bank statement reconciliation, transaction matching, balance verification

## 📊 Recommended Sequence

### **Best Approach: Phase 15 First, Then Phase 14**

**Why?**
1. ✅ **Phase 15 is 90% done** (backend complete) - Quick win!
2. ✅ **Only needs frontend** (25-30 hours of UI work)
3. ✅ **High user value** (reconciliation is critical for accounting)
4. ✅ **No external dependencies** (no email service needed)
5. ✅ **Testing is straightforward** (upload files, match transactions)

**Then Phase 14:**
- More complex (requires Celery + Redis + Email)
- Can use mock email service initially
- Real email can be added later when you have credentials
